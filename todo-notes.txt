- Reddit press the button thing: just a button that says dont press it and the number of people who did.
- Funny Form: a really long form for people to sign up for email list but has lots of funny questions.


Notes
- To be able to use ‘git push google master’ (instead of git push origin master) and thus be able to push to google instead of github, replace the config file in the .git folder in the repo with this: 

[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = git@github.com:brettgoldstein3/brettgoldstein-site.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master
[credential]
	helper = gcloud.sh
[remote "google"]
	url = https://source.developers.google.com/p/caramel-granite-90206/
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/google/*
